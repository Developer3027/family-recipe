   "recipe_instructions": "Get a bowl big enough to hold the amount of eggs you want, plus whisking room. Get a second small bowl. Crack and empty a single egg into the small bowl. Inspect the egg, if you are satisfied pour into large bowl and repeat. The idea behind the smaller bowl is for egg inspection. Cracking and empting a bad egg into a bowl of 4 to 6 eggs is a sad morning. With eggs in the large bowl add salt and pepper, but remeber you can add more at the table. Throw in a few splashes of hot sauce. Whisk together. Heat medium skillet on medium low heat. Melt butter, just a pad, enough to grease the pan bottom with just a touch of taste. Pour in eggs on a hot skillet. Using a rubber tip spatula start scraping cooked egg off the skillet bottom. The trick here is remembering eggs will continue to cook after removal from the skillet. So scape and fold and flip until eggs are mostly, say 95% cooked. With inner egg on folds still moist, remove from heat and plate. Enjoy.",
